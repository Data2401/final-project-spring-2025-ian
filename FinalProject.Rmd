## R Markdown





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
diabetes_dataset <- read_csv("diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv")
View(diabetes_prediction_dataset)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
diabetes_dataset
# male datatset
male_data = diabetes_dataset %>% filter(gender == "Male")
# female dataset
female_data = diabetes_dataset %>% filter(gender == "Female")
female_data

# males and females within original dataset that have a "normal" A1C

female_data %>% filter(HbA1c_level <= 5.7) %>% tally()
male_data %>% filter(HbA1c_level <= 5.7) %>% tally()




# count of people (male and female) with both heart disease and diabetes
diabetes_dataset %>% filter(diabetes == 1, heart_disease == 1)
# count of overweight people based on bmi who have heart disease
diabetes_dataset %>% group_by(bmi >= 30) %>% filter(heart_disease == 1)
diabetes_dataset %>% group_by(bmi >= 30) %>% filter(heart_disease == 1) 


# "obese men" with bmi higher than 30 and that have diabetes (tally on second line)
male_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 1)
male_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 1) %>% tally()
# "obese women" with bmi higher than 30 and that have diabetes (tally on second line)
female_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 1)
female_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 1) %>% tally()
# "underweight men"  with bmi lower than 19 and that have diabetes (tally on second line)
male_data %>% filter(bmi <= 19, diabetes == 1)
male_data %>% filter(bmi <= 19, diabetes == 1) %>% tally()
# "underweight women"  with bmi lower than 19 and that have diabetes (tally on second line)
female_data %>% filter(bmi <= 19, diabetes == 1)
female_data %>% filter(bmi <= 19, diabetes == 1) %>% tally()
# the assumption is that overweight people are more likely to have diabetes. Below is the code and tally of MEN who are overweight in terms of bmi and DONT have diabetes
male_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 0)
male_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 0) %>% tally()
# the assumption is that overweight people are more likely to have diabetes. Below is the code and tally of WOMEN who are overweight in terms of bmi and DONT have diabetes
female_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 0)
female_data %>% filter(bmi >= 30, diabetes == 0) %>% tally()
 
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
